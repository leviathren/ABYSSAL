                <h2>The New Year - 2024</h2>
                
                <p>This post is part of <a href="https://32bit.cafe/holidays2023/" target="_blank">32BITMAS</a>'s blog carnival!</p>
                
                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>2023 was a wild ride for me. I started off the year going on a research cruise with my class, my second time on a research vessel. The first handful of months was just wrapping up my final semesters of college and doing a ton of hands-on work, which was a very welcome change and challenge since I lost two years of in-person experience during my time there due to Covid. I had never done so much in my field (marine and aquatic sciences) before these two classes I took, and I was doing research posters/presentations, symposiums, showcases, and restoration efforts for the first seven months of the year. My class even won several awards/rewards! I then was hired by my professor for a research technician position in her lab, and I spent my summer doing a lot of manual labor and some labwork at the nanoscience technology department.</p>
                <p>Then, a major life milestone occurred in August: I graduated with a bachelor's degree and walked the stage! It still feels kind of unreal; I've been a student all my life and following the expected track of a relatively academically achieving kid, and now that's done with (I do NOT plan on going back to school anytime soon...) and I'm thrust into the real, adult world without the structure of school. In a way, I feel less prepared than I did in high school, I felt more ambitious and mature and confident then, but now that I know more about the world and have experienced academia and the research field, I am so much more aware of all the things I don't know yet and it's intimidating. I'm currently still in that post-grad limbo of figuring out what I want/need to do next, but trying not to put too much pressure on myself to meet arbitrary standards I've subconsciously made for myself.</p>
                <p>From August to the end of the year, I spent lots of time with my family because I was going to school on the other side of the continent the last four years and missed them dearly. During this time is when I learned about the Web Revival and got into site-building!</p>
                <p>Overall, the year was eventfull and busy and I took the chance to slow down and relax once I went back home. I caught up with some childhood friends and helped deep clean most of the house, while driving my younger siblings around to and from school and spending quality time with them.</p>
                <h3>What's To Come</h3>
                <p>There were some hard parts of the year,  some deaths, and some depressive ruts here and there, but I'm happy to say this year was better than some of the past few recently, and I genuinely am looking forward to a new cycle in our lives. I feel like there's a shifting attitude amongst the people around me, maybe that's because my peers and I are at that age where people are either graduating or getting married or starting families (or all of the above), but for the first time in a while I feel like I'm looking forward to something, even if I'm not sure what that is quite yet.</p>
            </article>
            
            
            
            <article id="basics">
            
            <h2>Back to Basics</h2>
                
                <p>I had been using javascript to hide/show blog posts and different "pages" within pages, but it was getting all too messy and cluttered in the code and in my head and I've decided to go back to the basics. For example, this page will no longer use javascript to hide and show posts depending on what button you click. Instead, I'm going back to a scrolling "feed" of blog posts, as you see here, where all posts are displayed on one page and you can just click links that will take you to the corresponding post on the page.</p>
                
                <p>I figure since I'm not familiar with javascript and I'm not trying to do anything crazy with my site, I don't need anything fancy. I just wanted a blog page where I could share my writings, so a simple scrollable page is enough.</p>
                
                <p>I reminded myself that my interest in the small web was the focus of this project anyways, and part of that is allowing my site to be as simple as I want. There are many cool things that you can add to a site that I think are really cool and handy, but I had to acknowledge that my js capabilities are not sufficient enough right now and trying to figure it all out without a solid foundation in it was just slowing down the process of me actually making the stuff I want to share on my site. My conclusion is: it's ok to have a simple setup to display your work, because it's the stuff you make that people want to see, not how you display it! (Though those with an interest in backend will probably be just as interested in that too!)</p>

            <article id="smallweb">
                
                <h2>What is the "Small Web"?</h2>
                
                <h3>Intro</h3>
                
                <p>It's not a small spider's home. The "Small Web" is one of the many names that refers to the personal web, parts of the internet populated by people creating and sharing things for fun, rather than content made out of capitalist drive. The Small Web is part of a larger Web Revival Movement. You will probably hear these terms used interchangably, along with "Independent Web", "Old Web", and more, but what does it mean?</p>
                
                <h3>What Makes Up the Small Web?</h3>
                
                <p>The Small Web is slower-paced as opposed to fast-paced content such as short-form videos and limited character-count posts. Things you'll commonly come across on the small web are blog posts, forums, personal websites, webrings, and more. It exists on the outskirts of the internet, also known as the "Peripheral Web", where corporations aren't present because it's far less populated. Contrast this to the "Core Web", which is made up of major platforms such as Google, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, you get the idea. This is where you would find the majority of people on the internet, and where things like algorithms find and push content to the user. This is the main feature of the Core Web: shorter content, delivered quickly.</p>
                
                <p>Back to the Peripheral Web, or Small Web, you often have to search for content yourself. Take this site for example, you most likely found neocities.org somewhere, and somehow, through a lot of clicking I imagine, you ended up here. It didn't pop up at the top of your feed somewhere, because there is no algorithm out here. What I'm trying to say in a long-winded way, is that it takes more time for things to happen in the Small Web. It is also called the Slow Web for this reason.</p>
                
                <h3>Why the Small Web?</h3>
                
                <p>For many who have migrated out here, this is a relieving break from an overwhelming digital culture that moves very quickly. Many people suffer from information overload due to the constant bombardment (I know, that's a strong word) of stuff that pops up on people's feeds. Consider how on many social media platforms, something may show on your feed that you may not be interested in, just because the algorithm thought you might be. Sometimes, you just want to see something specific you're feeling that day, so the Small - or Slow - Web, is what people go to for that. You may visit your favorite site you have bookmarked, or you may sift through posts on a forum dedicated to a certain topic you're interested in. </p>
                
                <h3>Wrap it Up</h3>
                
                <p>What you need to know if you're venturing into the Small Web for the first time, is that it is a place with a focus on building community, creativity, privacy, and fun. Things like NFT's, AI, corporate greed, and bad-faith gotcha arguments are widely unwelcome. You may participate or hang out on the Small Web in a myriad of ways, the limit is your imagination!</p>
