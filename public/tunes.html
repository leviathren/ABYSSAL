                            This song evokes such an energy in me, I always stop to lipsync or thrash to it when it comes on. I think it's one of the best from their album, <i>POST HUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR</i>, and it really captures the apocalyptic, cult themes in it.

                            This song is so psychedelic and whimsy, it makes me feel like I'm floating through music and colors. I love whatever instrument they're using for that airy string plucking sound.. I'm not sure what it is but it sounds like a harpsichord. The song's a bit of goth and experimental rock. This song has gotten me into binge-listening to their entire discography.

                            This song was highly anticipated and I listened to it the day it was released and... I literally LAUGHED in excitement and hype because it was even better than I hoped (not that I have low expectations for BMTH, it was just that good). I don't even know how to describe it in terms of music genres, it's like something uniquely BMTH that I love. It's a similar vibe to AmEN!.

                            It's 1/18/24, a week after initially writing the above and I've only been listening to it more. I just have it looping, not with the goal of getting them to top charts necessarily, but genuinely because I can't get enough of this song and I find myself literally CRAVING it. They must really be lacing their songs with siren abilities because I genuinely (/lh, /hj) feel like I'd be willing to join Oli's cult because this song has me mesmorized. (BMTH's theme has been cult stuff)
